	<!-- trs.lma:
		 0 means that the check for the Lock Modified Assets (LMA) game option
		 in the EXE is disabled for all savegames. LMA will then still disable
		 access to developer tools (even if cheats are enabled through
		 CivilizationIV.ini).

		 1 means that the check is disabled for savegames created by other mods,
		 i.e. for savegames that lack a particular bit that the Taurus DLL sets.

		 2 means that the check is always enabled when loading savegames.

		 In any case, LMA is never _written_ into savegames that are exported
		 through Ctrl+Shift+S. For values 1 and 2, LMA _will_ be written into
		 (non-exported) Taurus savegames even if the Save Mod Name option on
		 the mod option screen is disabled. (BtS will then be unable to load
		 those saves.)

		 Caveat: When not disabled, the LMA check in the EXE may crash to
		 desktop (instead of merely rejecting a save) when the original assets
		 (BtS/ Warlords/ base game folder) have been modified. Perhaps also when
		 there are custom assets under My Game. This appears to happen due to a bug
		 in the EXE. -->
