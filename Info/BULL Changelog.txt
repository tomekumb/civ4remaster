1. INTRODUCTION

This file lists the new features and fixes contained in each BULL release.  The changes for each 
release are grouped into two major sections--CHANGES and MODDING--and within each section further 
into New Features, Improvements, and Bug Fixes.

The CHANGES sections are for end-users and list the visible changes in BULL.  New Features cover 
major new additions that add completely new functionality.  Improvements are smaller changes made 
to existing features.  Finally, Bug Fixes cover fixes to existing features in both BTS and BULL.

The MODDING sections are mostly of interest to C++ modders merging BULL into their own mods or 
Python modders using BUG and/or BULL.  Changes that affect the Python API are listed along with 
new events and gameutils callbacks.

Note: Changes marked [BUG] only take effect when the optional BUG Mod is installed.
