trs.doc: Will try to keep this file up to date. Taurus additions here and
in program code are tagged with "trs." or "trs.CAT" comments, where CAT
describes th category of the change. There is also a Git repository:

MODDING with BULL
=================

1. Introduction
2. Optional Components
3. Events
4. Python API


____________________________________________________________________________________________________
1. INTRODUCTION

This file contains information of use to modders and users wishing to build their own custom DLL from BULL's source code.

The SDK folder includes all of the source files included with BTS along with the ones changed by BULL. I have marked all changes with single-line start and end comments such as these:

	// BUG - Combat Events - start
			CvEventReporter::getInstance().combatRetreat(this, pDefender);
	// BUG - Combat Events - end

Or you can use a tool like WinMerge to find all the differences by comparing the entire source tree to the original BTS files.

trs.doc: About installing the compiler, see Leoreth's guide:

When using a more recent version of the Visual Studio IDE than VS2010,
also consider this CFC post:

The build system has moved into a subfolder "project" inside SDK.
All local paths should be defined in project/Makefile.settings. Attempting to compile
without setting any paths should cause that file to be generated.
For documentation about the Makefile, see this thread:

2. OPTIONAL COMPONENTS

The following are all of the compile-time options for BULL. Each one has a unique preprocessor flag that you must define to enable the component. You do this with the /D option in your makefile.

[0] BUFFY
(trs.doc: There aren't going to be multiple HOF-compatible mods, so this option
is no longer fully supported. Well, so far only GameSetUpCheck.txt has been
removed.)

		Flags the saved game as a HOF-compatible game

3. EVENTS

These new events have already been added to BUG, but if you want to use them in a non-BUG-based mod you must add them yourself to the top of CvEventManager. (trs.doc: Never mind this. There is no non-BUG-based version of Taurus.)
